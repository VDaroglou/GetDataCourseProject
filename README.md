# GetDataCourseProject
Repository for Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

## Overview
The goal of this Course project is to create an R-script that takes raw data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, imports it into R, and transforms it into a tidy data subset.
The source data is available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#


This Repo contains:
- [run_analysis.R](./run_analysis.R)    R Script to transform raw data set in a tidy one
- [tidy_data_set.txt](./tidy_data_set.txt)	The tidy data set
- [codebook.md](./codebook.md) 		  Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data
- [README.md](./Readme.md)		    This file. README.md describes the overall process.
