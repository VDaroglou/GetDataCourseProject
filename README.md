# GetDataCourseProject
Repository for Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

## Overview
The goal of this Course project is to create an R-script that takes raw data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, imports it into R, and transforms it into a tidy data subset.
The source data is available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#


This Repo contains:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- tidydataset.txt	The tidy data set
- CodeBook.md 		CodeBook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
- README.md			This file. README.md describes the overall process
